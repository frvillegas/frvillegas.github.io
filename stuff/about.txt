I am a mathematician mainly interested in Number Theory and all of its
ramifications.

I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and have worked in various
countries over the years. I recently retired from [ICTP](www.ictp.it)
(The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics) in
Italy.

This site contains my work and thoughts on the many subjects that
interest me.
