Fernando Rodriguez Villegas

I am mathematician mainly interested in Number Theory and all of its
ramifications.

I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and worked in various
countries over the years. I recently retired from ICTP in Italy.

This site contains my work and thoughts on the many subject that
interest me.
