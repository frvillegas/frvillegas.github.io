I am mathematician mainly interested in Number Theory and all of its
ramifications.

I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and worked in various countries
over the years. I recently retired from [ICTP](www.ictp.it) in Italy.

This site contains my work and thoughts on the many subject that
interest me.
