In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student [Manjil
P. Saikia](https://manjilsaikia.in/) to give a mini-course at the
University of Vienna. I also gave then a general talk about the puzzle
[Blet](/pdf/2018-blet.pdf). Later in the year I gave a [Basic Notions
Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnknYZ7B6oTI9zT4i0tMhUzZK)
on the puzzle at ICTP.

As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and
then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the
[result](/text/2018-blet-transcript.md).
