In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student M. Saskia to
give a mini-course at the University of Vienna. I also gave a general
talk  about the puzzle [Blet](/pdf/2018-blet.pdf). Later in the year I
have a Basic Notions Seminar on the puzzle at ICTP.

As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and
then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the
[result](/text/2018-blet-transcript.md).
