These are the [slides](/pdf/public-talks/cont-ed.pdf) of a talk I gave
in the UT Odyssey public lecture series in 2007. It was a partly
historical talk on the way certain puzzles seem to grab the public's
attention and become an obsession for a period of time, Rubik's cube
being a classic example of the recent past. Another wildly popular
puzzle was the [Famous Trick
Donkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Trick_Donkeys) 1858
puzzle by Sam Lloyd.

The original links on the slides don't seem to work anymore. The first
is probably this
[animation](https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bubble_sort_animation.gif).

The second one needs java to work but at least the description of the
information on the *Get my goat!* puzzle from 1914 is still
[available](https://www.johnrausch.com/SlidingBlockPuzzles/classic.html)
without it.
