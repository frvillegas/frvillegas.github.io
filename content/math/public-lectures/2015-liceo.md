Frequently groups of high-school students come to visit ICTP. One of
their standard activities is to attend a short talk by a scientist.
A number of times I gave one of these talks. In this
[case](/pdf/15-liceo-talk.pdf) it was a talk for Italian students and
I discussed a bit the mathematics of information transmission.
