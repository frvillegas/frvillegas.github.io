I gave a the kick-off Basic Notions talk at ICTP in 2014 on *Impartial
Games* (one of the topics of the course [Math, Puzzles and
Computers]({{< relref "../lecture-notes/math-puzzles-and-computers"
>}} "")).

I expected students in the class to connect to puzzles and eventually
to the corresponding mathematics through a chilhood experience.  It is 
certainly what happened to me while preparing the lectures. 

I have a somewhat vague but powerful memory of being introduced to the
standard version of the game of Nim at an early age. I was fascinated
to learn so many years later how the theory of a very general class of
games (impartial games) all boil down somehow to Nim.
