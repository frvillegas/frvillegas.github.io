I gave some version of this lecture on the Mathematics of the
football/soccer ball several times, in different places and in various
languages.

>[Gonit Sora](https://gonitsora.com/about-us/) is
a multi lingual (English and Assamese) web magazine devoted to
publishing well written and original articles related to science in
general and mathematics in particular.

One of its founders and current editor is [Manjil
P. Saikia](https://manjilsaikia.in/), a former ICTP Diploma student,
who invited me to give this online talk.

> Abstract: *How to build something spherical out of pieces all of
roughly the same shape? This problem concerns the structure of balls
for many games, special molecules, domes and viruses. In this talk we
will discuss some of the geometry that these structures share and how
the constraints imposed by physical space lead to similar solutions.*
