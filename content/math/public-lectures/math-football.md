I gave some version of this lecture on the Mathematics of the
football/soccer ball several times, in different places and in various
languages.

How to build something spherical out of pieces all of roughly the same
shape? This problem concerns the structure of balls for many games,
special molecules, domes  and viruses. In this talk we will discuss
some of the geometry that these structures share and how the
constraints imposed by physical space lead to similar solutions.
