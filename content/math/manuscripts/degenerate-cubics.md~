These are unpublished [notes](/pdf/Cubic-ok.pdf) in Spanish, written
in 1985 when I was finishing my undergraduate degree in Buenos Aires,
on defining a group law on degenerate cubics. More precisely, on
cubics consisting of a smooth conic and a line. Depending on the
number of intersection points of the conic and the line over the given
ground field (0,1, or 2 points) you get the circle, the additive or
the multiplicative group respectively.
