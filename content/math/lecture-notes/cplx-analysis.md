These are [notes](/pdf/CA/2006-cplx-analysis.pdf) of a graduate course
in Complex Analysis at UT Austin in 2006. Pretty standard stuff for a
first course in Complex Analysis.

The history of the proof of Cauchy's theorem has its [twists and
turns](https://folk.ntnu.no/hanche/art/goursat/). I always liked
Goursat's [proof](/pdf/CA/goursat-pf-cauchy-thm-BF02418419.pdf) that
does not require continuity of first partial derivatives.
