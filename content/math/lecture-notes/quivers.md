These are [notes](/pdf/Bologna-notes-Villegas.pdf) (taken by
E. Vitale) of a [summer school](https://eventi.unibo.it/bip-quiver/summer-school) held at the  University of Bologna in the week of 22-26 May, 2023 as part of the program *Quiver Representations, Quiver Varieties and Combinatorics*.

This is the announcement for the course.
 

#### Counting representations of quivers over finite fields

*In these lectures I will present the calculation of the title in the
case of the star-shaped quivers related to character varieties based
on my joint work with E. Letellier and T. Hausel. The starting point
will be a formula of Hua for a general quiver. The basic tool used is
the combinatorics of symmetric functions and generating functions,
which I will discuss from scratch.*
