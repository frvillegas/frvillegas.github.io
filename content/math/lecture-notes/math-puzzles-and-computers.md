In the early 2000's while monkeying around with [lattice
polygons](/pdf/12-polygons.pdf), I came up with a puzzle that looked
interesting.  I named it Blet after my daughter Malena saying one day
out of the blue: *Blet, suena como un tomat*.  (To this day nobody can
really figure out what she meant by it.)

I discussed the puzzle with my then colleagues at UT, Austin, Felipe
Voloch and Lorenzo Sadun, and together worked out pretty much the
whole thing and [published](/pdf/blet.pdf) the results. (In
2018 I gave two general talks about Blet in
[Vienna](/pdf/2018-blet.pdf) and at the [Basic Notions Seminar]({{<
relref "../public-lectures/blet" >}}) at ICTP.)

Somehow the Mathematics behind the puzzle and its solution (lifting
$SL(2,Z)$ to the universal cover of $SL(2,R)$ and so on) is more
sophisticated than the puzzle itself, which is innocent enough. 

It occurred to me then that it might be a good idea to teach a course
involving interesting Mathematics with puzzles as a motivation. It
turns out that there is a fair number of puzzles, some very
well-known, that fit the bill. The result was the undergraduate course
*Math, Puzzles and Computers* that I developed and taught at UT
several times.

Here are the actual lecture
[notes](/pdf/S07/2007-math-puzzles-and-computers.pdf) for the Spring
2007 version and these are the class
[notes](/pdf/S04/2004-math-puzzles-computers.pdf) for the Spring 2004
version.

My personal goal was to use puzzles as an excuse to explain
some basic mathematical concepts to scientific minded students.

(then graduate student at UT Austin) on our discussion about puzzles
and math.

I gave a [Basic Notions Seminar]({{< relref
"../public-lectures/impartial-games" >}}) talk at ICTP on impartial
games, one of the topics of the course.
