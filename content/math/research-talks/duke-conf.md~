These are the [slides](/pdf/research-talks/2019-duke-conf-hd.pdf) of
my talk at Bill Duke's birthday conference held at ETH in Zurich. I
later wrote and extended
[abstract](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02722v1) of this talk. It
includes a proof of the calculation of the mixed Hodge numbers of a
hypergeometric motive. The original conjecture on Hodge numbers of is
a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0607016) of Corti and Golyshev. A
[proof](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01704) was given by Fedorov.
