These are the [slides](/pdf/research-talks/tate-abel-talk-handout.pdf) of my talk at
the first Abel [conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20220801171847/https://www.ima.umn.edu/2010-2011/SW1.3-5.11/10506) in honor of John Tate at the University of
Minessota in 2011. It is a summary of my work with T. Hausel and
E. Letellier.
