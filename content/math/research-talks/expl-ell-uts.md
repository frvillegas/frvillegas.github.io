These are the
[slides](/pdf/research-talks/FRV-explicit-elliptic-units-I.pdf) of a
talk I gave some time in 1997 on my
[joint](/pdf/frv-hajir-exp-ell-uts.pdf) work with Farshid Hajir on
defining explicit elliptic units; basically trying, and to some degree
succeeding, to tame the 24-th roots of unity that arise from the
transformation formula of Dedekind's eta function.
