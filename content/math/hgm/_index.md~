HGM stands for *Hypergeometric Motives*.

This project got started at an amazing workshop held in Benasque,
Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009.

There we started to work in a small group (S. Baig, H. Cohen,
Ph. Candelas, X. de la Ossa, M. Watkins and myself) on computing
L-functions coming from families of varieties whose periods are given
by classical hypergeometric series. The famous quintic family of
threefolds of mirror symmetry being the quintessential example.

I kept the wiki [pages](/pdf/hgm/Benasque09_p-adic-L-Functions-Wiki.pdf)
that my (at the time) Ph.D. student S. Baig wrote recording the daily
progress (my memory is that Henri and Sal working together would
announce a speed increase by a non-trivial factor every day). 

This Benasque meeting counts among the most exciting and succesful
collaborations at a workshop that I have experienced.

I late wrote an [account](/pdf/hgm/benasque09.pdf) of what we did.
