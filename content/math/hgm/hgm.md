This project got started at an fabulous
[workshop](https://www.benasque.org/2009numbers/) held in Benasque,
Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. I
wrote this [post]({{<relref "/writing/benasque" >}}) in my blog after
returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007. In
my own notes I added:

*The place is truly amazing. Mountains falling over you as you walk
 down the street.*  

The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute *exotic*
L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular
forms. It was something B. Conrey was pushing to achieve in the early
stages of what later became the [LMFDB](https://www.lmfdb.org)
database and which, incidentally, now has a beta section on
[HGM](https://beta.lmfdb.org/Motive/Hypergeometric/Q/)'s.

In the 2007 proposal for the workshop I wrote:

*Examples of the L-functions we have in mind are those associated to
representations of Weyl groups, of type say G_2, E_6, E_7, E_8,
etc. For some of these specific methods are available, for example via
hypergeometric sums, that don't exist in general making them more
amenable to computations.*

and (not exactly  an original thought but certainly accurate
nevertheless): 

*It is by now well established that computations in Number Theory are
 of crucial importance in advancing the subject. However, it's fair to
 say that the computational and experimental aspects of higher rank
 L-functions remains largely unexplored. With bigger and faster
 machines, as well a vaster experience and larger number of
 researchers in the area, we are now in a better position than not
 long ago to pursue this effort.*


In Benasque we started to work in a small group (S. Baig, H. Cohen,
Ph. Candelas, X. de la Ossa, M. Watkins and myself) on computing
L-functions coming from families of varieties whose periods are given
by classical hypergeometric series. The famous quintic family of
threefolds of mirror symmetry being the quintessential example.

I kept these wiki
[pages](/pdf/hgm/Benasque09_p-adic-L-Functions-Wiki.pdf) that my (at
the time) Ph.D. student S. Baig wrote recording our daily progress (my
memory is that Henri and Sal working together would announce a speed
increase by a non-trivial factor every day).

This Benasque meeting counts among the most exciting and succesful
collaborations at a workshop that I have ever experienced.

I late wrote a bit more detailed [account](/pdf/hgm/benasque09.pdf) of
what we did.
