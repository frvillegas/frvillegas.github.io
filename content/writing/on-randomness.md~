Iperborea is an italian publishing house founded by Emilia Lodigiani
in 1987 which aims to bring to Italian readers the literature of
northern Europe. Their books have a distinctive format and texture of
their covers making them instantly recognizable while browsing in a
bookstore. Not all of their titles are easy to find in English in
Italy so they are a good way to connect to Scandinavian culture while
also practicing my Italian. I read about the incredible Lake Nyos
disaster in Cameroon for example, in [Il Enigma del Lago
Rosso](https://iperborea.com/titolo/426/lenigma-del-lago-rosso/) by
Frank Westerman (translated from the Dutch); there is also an English
translation: [Choke
Valley](https://www.frankwesterman.nl/books/choke-valley).

I picked up *Orden som formade Sverige* by Elisabeth Ã…sbrink in
Italian at the Minerva bookstore in Trieste.  The literal translation
of the title is *The words that shaped Sweden* and has actually been
translated to English as *Made in Sweden: Made in Sweden: 25 ideas
that created a country* but I am reading it in Italian (*Made in
Sweden: le parole che hanno fatto la Svezia*).

The book consists of short chapters discussing some event of the
history of Sweden, centered around language or culture in some way,
ordered chronolgically.  I found the style, pace and perspective in
each topic fascinating.

There is the amazing story mentioned in passing (in Chapter I) of
runes inscribed in a marble sculpture of a lion once in the port of
Piraeus in Greece and now in the Arsenal in Venice. The text was
carved in the 11th century and is now so weathered down that reading
it is a huge challenge. Various reconstructions exist but whatever the
precise meaning it is clear that it is basically just like a modern
grafitti of the sort *X and his pals were here*, written by a bunch of
early Swedes far from home and with time to kill. I will come back to
runes in another post as they were important to me as a [kid]({{<
relref from-here-to-there >}}) via *Voyage to the Centre of the Earth*
of J. Verne .

But the main story for this post is in Chapter 6 about the Kalmar
Union. This is a major event in the history of Scandinavia of the late
1300's where the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were joined
under a single monarch. Erik Gustaf Geijer an early 1800's Swedish
writer, historian, composer famously said that the Kalmar Union was
*an event that looks like an idea*.

I was struck by this because it sounds exactly what Darwin would say
about life. Life is a random event that looks intentional, like
someone, a conscious being, intended it, wanted it. Randomness that
looks like volition.

But then again this is hard for us humans. Our brain evolved to look
for patterns and extract meaning. A piece of marble in form of a lion
with carved symbols that look like a message from an unknown language
cannot just be random.

It is hard for us to understand what random means. A common exercise
in a lecture on probability is to divide the class in two and ask one
group to toss a coin 100 times recording the outcome and the other to
write down a made-up sequence of such tosses. Typically, it is later
easy to figure out which sequence came from the actual coin flips: the
one that includes strings of six heads in a row.

[Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law) is the
observation that in large data sets of unstructured numbers the
distribution of their first digits among 1,2,...,9 is not actually
uniform but logarithmic. So the proportion of numbers in the set with
a given first digit is roughly like this



| Digit | Prob|
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |

| 1 |	30.1% |

| 2 |	17.6% |	

| 3 |	12.5% |	

| 4 |	9.7% |	

| 5 |	7.9% |	

| 6 |	6.7% |	

| 7 |	5.8% |	

| 8 |	5.1% |	

| 9 |	4.6% |
