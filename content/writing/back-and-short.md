I’ve lived in the US now for over 22 years. I have encountered two
dollar bills exactly three times (I kept them all). The first time was
around Harvard Square as change in a store. It was so strange. 

I’ve seen a few dollar coins too.  Usually all of them at once
unfortunately. At least 15 years ago, if you bought a NJ transit train
ticket in a machine at the station and paid with a 20 dollar bill the
change came clanking down in a stream of dollar coins. They are
heavy. 

And just the other day reading a post at the The Oil Drum encountered
the word copacetic for the first time in my life, according to World
Wide Words a uniquely American slang word meaning “fine, excellent,
going just right”. (Not much use for it these days.) 

On my way back from Vancouver once the US customs officer that checked
my passport, after finding out I was a mathematician, told me:
[thinking pause] “I hope things add up for you”. 

I hope the post does.
