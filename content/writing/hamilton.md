Towards the end of my Ph.D. years at The Ohio State University a bunch
of graduate students thought of publishing our own magazine. We
struggled to come up with a good name for the magazine so after a lot
of back and forth we settled on "The Empy Set". The OSU graduate
advisor found this too nihilistic and wanted us to pick a different
name. We nevertheless wrote what inevitably ended up being the only
issue of "The Empty Set" and circulated it among the department.

The following article on the discovery of the quaternions by Hamilton
was my main contribution to the magazine. I read Hamilton son's letter
on the story in the preface to his collected works and found it
fascinating. I still remember being really struck but how well it
captured the way a mathematical problem can take over (*...an
under-current thought was going through my mind...*).

A nice [post](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node24.html) by
John Baez has more about the actual bridge in which Hamilton famously
inscribed the quaternion relations with his penknife (now commemorated
with a plaque).

I borrowed a few.
