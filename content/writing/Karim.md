C’est le moment des braves

So would Karim write to Ralph at precisely midday, to say it was time for lunch. Every working day for years.

So Ralph told us, the many people crammed in the Parrochia di San Michele Arcangelo in Sgonico, during Karim’s funeral. A laic ceremony.

Outside, the massive trees with their large yellowing leaves were already in winter. The air was wet. The bright yellow contrasted with the dark color of people’s clothes and the heavy silence and the concentrated and sad look of people’s faces.

Many went to the front of the church to say a few words about Karim. Some touched the coffin as they spoke.

This is what I myself wrote a few days after Karim’s passing, still in shock.

“What an incredible loss. Karim was truly unique and the world is much poorer without him. It is really sad to imagine not bumping into Karim at ICTP, not sharing a coffee, a bon mot, a smile, lunch. À bientôt Karim, you will always be in our hearts.”

C’est le moment des braves repeated Ralph. They spoke French when alone.
