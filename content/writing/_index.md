I started a [blog](https://frvillegas.wordpress.com/) on Wordpress in
2007, in part with the hope it could be a way to stay in touch with
the participants of an [AIM](https://aimath.org/ "AIM") workshop on
the Geometry of Character Varieties we co-organized with E. Letellier
and T. Hausel.

 But it was also essentially my personal excuse to have a go at
producing and putting out in the world some of the kind of writing
that had always been in my mind. I called the blog "Math Life" in
fact, suggesting its ambiguous quality.

I have now concentrated the output of my various interests on this
site. Below you can find some the short posts I wrote for the blog
that I feel are worth keeping. The earliest of these posts is [Dancing
Numbers]({{< relref "dancing-numbers" >}} "").
