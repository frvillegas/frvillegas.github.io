Dear All,

This is the first of what I hope is a long-running monthly newsletter with (mostly mathematical) updates from yours truly.

Now that I have retired from ICTP, I am working on the launch of an independent website with all my stuff. Please check it out.

I also opened a zulip site that I hope will be useful for discussions on various mathematical projects organized by topics. 
You can access it here:

More to come!

Best,

Fernando
