I was back in Oxford to give a talk at the
[workshop](https://www.claymath.org/events/the-pw-conjecture-in-non-abelian-hodge-theory/) on *The P=W Conjecture in Non Abelian Hodge Theory*, part of the  Clay Mathematical Institute conference of 2024.

I arrived a day early, on Saturday, and spent the day walking around town remembering the old days (2009-2010 when I visited for the year). There was some kind of graduation ceremony happening and though I don't really like to take pictures of people I could not resist this one. I love the sense of determination of who I imagine are the graduating student and his sisters. Look at the way their steps are perfectly in sync.
