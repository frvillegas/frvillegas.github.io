- I was back in [[Oxford]] to give a talk at the
  [workshop](https://www.claymath.org/events/the-pw-conjecture-in-non-abelian-hodge-theory/)  on *The P=W Conjecture in Non Abelian Hodge Theory*, part of the  Clay institute conference of 2024.

I arrived a day early, on Saturday, and spent the day walking town remembering the old days (2009-2010 when I visited for the  year). There was some kind of graduation ceremony happening and though I don't really like to take pictures of people I could not resist this one. I love the sense of determination of who I imagine are the student and his sisters. Look at the way their steps are perfectly in sync.
