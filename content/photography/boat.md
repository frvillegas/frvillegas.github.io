I think this is the first picture I took focusing on a reflected image
in water. I liked the way the masts of the boats (straight, solid,
crucial to their life) appeared in this surrealistic, impressionistic
way. Since then when walking around Trieste near the sea or the canal
I always look at the scenes reflected on their surface and often take
a picture. It is now trivial to rotate and flip the picture so we
get a interesting view from a very weird angle.
