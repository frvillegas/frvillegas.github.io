I love this picture.

Early in the morning in the Barrio Gotico of Barcelona. As I walked
by I couldn't help hearing part of the conversation. The young woman
seemed to be asking in good but accented Spanish where she could find
a particular kind of cheese. I imagine she thought the old ladies were
locals that would know.
