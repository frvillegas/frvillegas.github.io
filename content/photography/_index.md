With the advent of a powerful digital camera on my phone, at all times
in my pocket, I started taking lots of pictures while wandering
around. In 2017, at the repeated suggestion of my daughters, I got an
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/frvillegas/) account.

 I got in the habit of simply posting a picture every Saturday and one
every Sunday as a way to document what I found interesting or worth
remembering, particularly during my travels.

 I will post below a selection of pictures I took with some commentary.
