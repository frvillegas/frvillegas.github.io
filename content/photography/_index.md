With the advent of a powerful digital camera on my phone, at all times
in my pocket, I started taking lots of pictures while wandering
around. In 2007, at the repeated suggestion of my daughters, I got an
instagram account.

 I got in the habit of simply posting a picture every Saturday and one
every Sunday as a way to document what I found interesting or worth
remembering, particularly during my travels.
