After a fair number of iterations this is the result of my cooking
pasta with greens. At home we just call it *Pasta Verde*. This version
is with Swiss chard but a real nice combination is dandelion leaves
and Swiss chard. You can see how the various steps follow those for
cooking a risotto.


# 1
Start preparing about an hour in advance a thick broth to use to cook
the pasta. Include carrots is small cubes, some chopped greens (cicoria, leek
greens, etc.). The crucial ingredients are: a few tablespoons of
cooked chickpeas (from a can) and a few pieces of dry sourdough
bread. These will give the broth and later the pasta its creamy
texture as well as adding to the flavor. Let it cook for 45'-60'.

# 2
Cut-off the stems from the Swiss chard, put them on a colander on
top of the boiling broth and put a lid on.

Let the greens steam for 10'-15' and then set them aside for later. Keep
the broth boiling without a lid.

Blend the broth in the pot until there are no chunks.

# 4

Sauté the chopped white of a medium leek in olive oil in a pan until
starting to brown.

# 5

Add the pasta. I use typically *orechiette* but any other similar ones
would work. I count three handfuls per person

plus an extra one. Here it was for two people.

Mix the leeks and the pasta so as to get the pasta well covered in
oil. Sauté for a few minutes. Add the juice of half a lemon.

# 6

Start adding the broth with a ladle a few spoonfuls at a time. Lower
the broth fire so that it stays hot.

After about 5' add the Swiss chard chopped.

# 7
Check the pasta now fairly frequently to make sure it does not
overcook. It will take much longer cooked this way than what it says
on the package.

When the pasta is done (*al dente*) add (kosher) salt and pepper and a
fair amount of grated parmeggian cheese plus some olive oil. Mix
vigorously.

# 8

I typically add some finely chopped strong-flavored green on top of
portions in each dish. Rucola, for example, works well.
