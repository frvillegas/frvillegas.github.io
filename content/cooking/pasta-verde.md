After a fair number of iterations this is the result of my cooking
pasta with greens. At home we just call it *Pasta Verde*. This version
is with Swiss chard but a real nice combination is dandelion leaves
(*tarassaco* in Italian) and Swiss chard (*bieta*). You can see how
the various steps follow those for cooking a risotto.


# 1
Start preparing about an hour in advance a thick broth to use to
cook the pasta. Include carrots in small cubes, some chopped greens
(cicoria, leek greens, etc.). The crucial ingredients are: a few
tablespoons of cooked chickpeas (from a can) and a few pieces of dry
sourdough bread, crust and all. These will give the broth and later
the pasta its creamy texture as well as adding to the flavor. Let it
cook for 45'-60' in total.

# 2
Cut-off the stems from the Swiss chard, put them on a colander on
top of the boiling broth and put a lid on.

Let the greens steam for 10'-15' and then set them aside for later. Keep
the broth boiling without a lid.

Blend the broth in the pot until there are no chunks.  Lower
the broth fire so that it stays hot.

# 4
Sauté the chopped white of a medium leek in olive oil in a pan until
starting to brown.

# 5
Add the pasta. I use typically *orecchiette* but any other similar ones
would work. I count three handfuls per person

plus an extra one. Here it was for two people.

Mix the leeks and the pasta so as to get the pasta well covered in
oil. Sauté for a few minutes. Add the juice of half a lemon and stir
well.

# 6
Add broth with a ladle until it covers the pasta. Stir frequently so
that the pasta does not stick to the bottom of the pan.

After about 5' add the Swiss chard chopped.

Add more broth along the way a few spoonfuls at a time to keep the
right consistency (not too soupy or too thick). If it gets too thick
add boiling water instead.

Check the pasta every so often to make sure it does not overcook. It
will take much longer cooked this way than what it says on the
package.

When the pasta is done (*al dente*) add (kosher) salt and pepper and a
fair amount of grated parmeggian cheese plus some olive oil. Mix
vigorously.

# 8
I typically add some finely chopped strong-flavored green on top of
portions in each dish. Rucola, for example, works well.
