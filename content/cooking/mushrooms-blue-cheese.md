I am not sure where I got this from. I do remember my aunt, the writer
Alicia Plante, back in Buenos Aires, mentioning a recipe of baked fish
with blue cheese that I prepared a few times. In the US I adapted it
using big mushrooms instead of fish. But maybe I got the idea somewhere. 


# 1
Get some big round mushrooms, for example, shitake mushrooms. I read
that one should never wash the mushrooms with water as they get ruined
somehow but gently remove any impurities with a soft brush. Cut off
most of the stems of the mushrooms. 


# 2
Put some olive oil on each mushroom and fill them with blue
cheese. I used cheese that I bought on the farmer's market. The
stronger the better. Add some salt and pepper.


# 3
Prepare a tray by covering it with some oven paper. Place the
mushrooms with some space bewtween them. Bake in the oven at 180C for
about 15' to 20'.

# 4
After baking I put some chopped watercress (rucola would also be
good) on top.

# 5
The mushrooms release quite a bit of water so the oven paper is a good
idea. Make sure the liquid doesn't burn.
