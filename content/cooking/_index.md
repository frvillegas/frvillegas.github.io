 I took a course some years ago at
[Eataly](https://www.eataly.net/it_it/negozi/trieste) on how to make
italian *risotto* and loved it. One of the items we were suppose to
cover in the course but did not get to it was *pasta risottata*. I
thought it was a really intriguing concept.

Since then I started experimenting and making my own version of pasta
risottata even to the point of thinking that *risotto* is not just a
dish but a *process*: you can prepare a lot of things as if making a
risotto.

Luckily my family is happy with the result and it is now our standard
fare for lunch on weekends.

I will write below some of my thoughts and recipes of what came out of
this experience.
