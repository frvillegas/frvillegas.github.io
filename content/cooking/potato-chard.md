Many years ago after an invited seminar talk at
[ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/) in Vienna we went with my host
[Tamas Hausel](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/hausel-group/) and some
of his group for dinner to a Croatian restaurant. I had fish I think
and a side dish of potatoes and chard, which I really loved. I have
been trying to reproduce it from memory ever since.  I found out
later (while on vacation in
[Lussinpicolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Lo%C5%A1inj)) that
it is actually a standard traditional dish in Croacia known as
*blitva* (which simply means chard). The following is my elaboration
on the basic theme.

# 1
Start by peeling and cutting up into small cubes three medium size
potatoes

# 2
Cut off the stems from the Swiss chard (I also added some leaves
from a local variety)

# 3
Heat a medium size pan (7.5/10 in my induction stove) and put in
the potatoes.  It's OK if they get stuck a bit to the bottom of the
pan but stir with a wooden spatula to keep them moving. A brown layer
will form. About 5'. Make sure the potatoes dry up.

# 4
Add a fair amount of olive oil and let the potatoes fry for another 5'
or so, always stirring and not letting them get stuck to the bottom of
the pan too long. Boil water in a kettle.

# 5
Add the boiling water to the potatoes, to a level a bit higher
than to covering them.

# 6
Let the potatoes cook for another 5'-10' and then add the Swiss chard cut
up in small chunks. Add more boiling water if necessary.

# 7
Cut some cheese in little cubes and add to the mix. (I prefer a sharp flavored cow-milk
cheese for this.)

Now it's a matter of balance on how much more time to cook the dish
and this can get tricky.

Ideally the chard should be soft, the potatoes should keep some
sturdiness but they should also contribute to make the dish creamy,
the cheese should be completely melted away and the overall
consistency should not be too soupy or too hard. It is important to
regulate well how much boiling water to add during the whole process
(like in a risotto) to get the right result.

Add (kosher) salt, pepper, some olive oil and stir well. As a final
touch, add the zest of one lemon (or alternatively, the juice of
half a lemon).
