One of the joys of cooking (of living!) in Italy is the variety of
products you can find in the market.

Supermarkets tend to be small (navigating them at peak time a
challenge) and the selection limited but the quality is always very
high. You could basically buy anything with your eyes closed and not
be dissapointed (or ruin your appetite or your health if repeated).

I am thinking specifically of the farmer's markets in the public
squares and the incredible variety of vegetables and especially herbs
you might find. Many are just wild plants (unimprovably: *erbe
spontanee* or *selvatiche* in Italian). One of the first I tried was
*scoplit*, already some years ago.

Scoplit is the Slovenian name for this herb and it's what is called in the
Trieste region. Its latin name is *Silene vulgaris*, in English its apparently called
*bladder campion* or *maidenstears*.

In any case, we mainly eat the leaves that look like somewhat pale,
wide grass.

One can use it in a *risotto* or other dishes but its flavor is quite
delicate and I prefer to just make a pesto.

Another, delicate and interesting herb I bought at the market
(grazie [Matteo](https://www.ortofelicebio.com/)!)
is *erba
stella* (*Plantago coronopus* in Latin, *minutina* or *buckshorn
Plantain* in English).

Both scoplit and minutina are native to Europe, northern Africa and
parts of Asia, though they have been introduced in many other areas.

Looking at the photos of these plants in the wild I will admit that
not that long ago I would have never imagined eating them (*del bald√≠o
a su mesa* my friend Jorge would say).

Here are the ingredients of a pesto I prepared a few days ago. I didn't actually
measure anything so it was all made *a ojo*. It was pretty good
though.

- Scoplit leaves
- Rucola
- Erba stella
- Juice of one lime
- *Pinoli* (pine nuts)
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- Grated parmigian cheese

Put everything in food processor (the *robot* in Italian!) and mix it
up.
