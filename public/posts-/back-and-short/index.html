<p>And just the other day reading a post at the The Oil Drum encountered
the word copacetic for the first time in my life, according to World
Wide Words a uniquely American slang word meaning “fine, excellent,
going just right”. (Not much use for it these days.)</p>
<p>On my way back from Vancouver once the US customs officer that checked
my passport, after finding out I was a mathematician, told me:
[thinking pause] “I hope things add up for you”.</p>
<p>I hope the post does.</p>
