few interesting taxi rides back and forth to the airport over the
years.</p>
<p>I’ll leave aside the late night taxi ride where the driver, a young
woman, told a few off-color jokes (“you are not a prude man, are
you?”); including one that I am pretty sure was popular when I was in
primary school. (Let’s just say that it involved traveling by camel in
the desert.)</p>
<p>More curious was the guy with the fourth dimension. It started
innocently enough: “what’s your business?” or something like
that. When I said I taught math (often a risky move) he went off about
the fourth dimension and extra-terrestrial beings living among us. He
actually showed me a pile of issues of a magazine called “The Fourth
Dimension”. I also recall something about a meeting of
extra-terrestrials in Washington DC the following month. And this was
just a few minutes into the ride.</p>
<p>I then made a really reckless move. I mentioned that in fact, I was
currently working with some physicists (this was at the time of my
collaboration with Ph. Candelas and X. de la Ossa) and that in string
theory the thinking was that the universe was actually ten
dimensional.</p>
<p>The response was a chilly silence. I distinctively recall thinking:
the driver must be saying to himself “Now, there is a nut in this taxi
… and it is not me”.</p>
