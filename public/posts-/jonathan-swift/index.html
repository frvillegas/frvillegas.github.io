    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I listened to a fascinating podcast in the &ldquo;Past, Present, Future&rdquo;
series by David Runciman on the 1726 satire &ldquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels&rdquo; by
Jonathan Swift. Runciman gives an excellent summary of the various
journeys that Gulliver undertakes in this book; journeys to far away
lands were he encounters fantastic creatures and their world: tiny
people, giants, talking horses, and the like.</p>
<p>In one of these journeys Gulliver finds academics stubbornly
determined to strip language of all ambiguity. They start by taking
out adverbs, adjectives, articles and so on and eventually find
themselves with no words left. To communicate they are forced to carry
around bags full of objects. If they wanted to talk about a shoe say,
they would need to rummage in their bag until they find one to show.</p>
<p>The most astonishing episode though is about the &ldquo;Engine&rdquo;. Here Swift
describes a machine, thought to be based on Ramon Lull&rsquo;s (b. 1230&rsquo;s)
combinatorial philosophical system described in his book &ldquo;Ars Magna&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One may say that Lull wanted to create an algorithm that by
permutation of letters, words and basic concepts could arrive
unambiguously at the truth.</p>
<p>To quote Swift on the &ldquo;Engine&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to
arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant
person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,
might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics,
and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.”</p>
<p>As Runciman and others have pointed out Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;Engine&rdquo; sounds
eerily just like ChatGPT. What would Swift write if he traveled to
our world today?</p>
