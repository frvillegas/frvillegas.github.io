      <description>Walking to the riva after getting gelato at Marco. Maybe these musicians were part of the ensemble playing on the temporary stage on Piazza Unita related to the Pope&amp;rsquo;s visit to Trieste. Enjoying the sun and the ocean breeze during a break.&#xA;View this post on Instagram </description>

      <description>I love this picture.&#xA;Early in the morning in the Barrio Gotico of Barcelona. As I walked by I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help hearing part of the conversation. The young woman seemed to be asking in good but accented Spanish where she could find a particular kind of cheese. I imagine she thought the old ladies were locals that would know.&#xA;View this post on Instagram </description>

      <description>I was back in Oxford to give a talk at the workshop on The P=W Conjecture in Non Abelian Hodge Theory, part of the Clay Mathematical Institute conference of 2024.&#xA;I arrived a day early, on Saturday, and spent the day walking around town remembering the old days (2009-2010 when I visited for the year). There was some kind of graduation ceremony happening and though I don&amp;rsquo;t really like to take pictures of people I could not resist this one.</description>
