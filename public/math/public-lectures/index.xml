      <description>I gave some version of this lecture on the Mathematics of the football/soccer ball several times, in different places and in various languages.&#xA;Florence 20/05/2024 Gonit Sora (online) 14/06/2021 Form their website:&#xA;Gonit Sora is a multi lingual (English and Assamese) web magazine devoted to publishing well written and original articles related to science in general and mathematics in particular.&#xA;One of its founders and current editor is Manjil P. Saikia, a former ICTP Diploma student, who invited me to give this online talk.</description>

      <description>In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student Manjil P. Saikia to give a mini-course at the University of Vienna. I also gave then a general talk about the puzzle Blet. Later in the year I gave a Basic Notions Seminar on the puzzle at ICTP.&#xA;As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the result.</description>

      <description>Frequently groups of high-school students come to visit ICTP. One of their standard activities is to attend a short talk by a scientist. A number of times I gave one of these talks. In this case it was a talk for Italian students and I discussed a bit the mathematics of information transmission.</description>

      <description>I gave a the kick-off Basic Notions talk at ICTP in 2014 on Impartial Games (one of the topics of the course Math, Puzzles and Computers).&#xA;I expected students in the class to connect to puzzles and eventually to the corresponding mathematics through a chilhood experience. It is certainly what happened to me while preparing the lectures.&#xA;I have a somewhat vague but powerful memory of being introduced to the standard version of the game of Nim at an early age.</description>

      <description>These are the slides of a talk I gave in the UT Odyssey public lecture series in 2007. It was a partly historical talk on the way certain puzzles seem to grab the public&amp;rsquo;s attention and become an obsession for a period of time, Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube being a classic example of the recent past. Another wildly popular puzzle was the Famous Trick Donkeys 1858 puzzle by Sam Lloyd.&#xA;The original links on the slides don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work anymore.</description>

      <description>At UT Austin there is a wonderful program of lectures for high-school students on some Saturday mornings. I gave a number of the talks there including one about lattice polygons and the number 12.</description>
