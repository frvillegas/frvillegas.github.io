      <description>The first thing to understand is that the question of the title is not a trivial one, especially if you have a beard.&#xA;So what is a maritozzo? It&amp;rsquo;s a Roman pastry consisting of a ball of sweet bread with a big gash in the middle completely filled with whipped cream. The New York Times calls them unnapealingly &amp;ldquo;Sweet Cream Buns&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to do them justice. It seems that maritozzi have become quite a thing in the US from what I can gather online.</description>
