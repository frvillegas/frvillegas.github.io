      <description>This project got started at an amazing workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. (I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007.)&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms. It was something B. Conrey was pushing to achieve in the early stages of what later became the LMFDB database and which, incidentally, now has a beta section on HGM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of my Ph.D. years at The Ohio State University together with a bunch of graduate students we thought of publishing our own magazine. We struggled to come up with a good name for the magazine so after a lot of back and forth we settled on &amp;ldquo;The Empy Set&amp;rdquo;. The OSU graduate advisor found this too nihilistic and wanted us to pick a different name. We nevertheless wrote what inevitably ended up being the only issue of &amp;ldquo;The Empty Set&amp;rdquo; and circulated it among the department.</description>

      <description>While I wait for my brain strings to settle after a long summer shuttling about I make a quick core dump before it’s all gone.&#xA;I spent two weeks in Benasque, Spain for the workshop P-adic analysis, Periods and Physics . We ended up being a very small group of participants, unfortunate in a way but the result was a very charming workshop. And what a place! Benasque is in a valley in the Spanish Pyrenees not far from the border with France, a small mountain town where you walk everywhere, surrounded by amazing mountains full of unbelievably beautiful hikes.</description>

      <description>These are the actual lecture notes for the Spring 2007 version of an undergraduate course at UT Austin with the above name that I developed. My personal goal was to use puzzles as an excuse to explain some basic mathematical concepts to scientific minded students.</description>

      <description>These are notes on approaching Bernoulli polynomials as eigenvalues of certain operators acting on polynomials. It is my re-interpretation of work of E. H. Lehmer. I wrote this at the end of my Ph.D. studies around 1989.</description>

      <description>Dear All,&#xA;This is the first of what I hope is a long-running monthly newsletter with (mostly mathematical) updates from yours truly.&#xA;Now that I have retired from ICTP, I am working on the launch of an independent website with all my stuff. Please check it out.&#xA;https://frvillegas.github.io/&#xA;I also opened a zulip site that I hope will be useful for discussions on various mathematical projects organized by topics. You can access it here:</description>
