      <description>This project got started at an amazing workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. (I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007.)&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms. It was something B. Conrey was pushing to achieve in the early stages of what later became the LMFDB database and which, incidentally, now has a beta section on HGM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
