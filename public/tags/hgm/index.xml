      <description>This project got started at a fabulous workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007. In my own notes I added:&#xA;The place is truly amazing. Mountains falling over you as you walk down the street.&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms.</description>

      <title>Mixed Hodge Numbers and Factorial Ratios</title>

      <description>These are the slides of my talk at Bill Duke&amp;rsquo;s birthday conference held at ETH in Zurich. I later wrote an extended abstract of this talk. It includes a proof of the calculation of the mixed Hodge numbers of a hypergeometric motive. The original conjecture on Hodge numbers of is a paper of Corti and Golyshev. A proof was given by Fedorov.</description>

      <title>Explicit Elliptic Units</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/math/research-talks/expl-ell-uts/</link>

      <description>These are the slides of a talk I gave some time in 1997 on my joint work with Farshid Hajir on defining explicit elliptic units; basically trying, and to some degree succeeding, to tame the 24-th roots of unity that arise from the transformation formula of Dedekind&amp;rsquo;s eta function.</description>
