</ul><p>While I wait for my brain strings to settle after a long summer
shuttling about I make a quick core dump before it’s all gone.</p>
<p>I spent two weeks in Benasque, Spain for the workshop P-adic analysis,
Periods and Physics . We ended up being a very small group of
participants, unfortunate in a way but the result was a very charming
workshop. And what a place! Benasque is in a valley in the Spanish
Pyrenees not far from the border with France, a small mountain town
where you walk everywhere, surrounded by amazing mountains full of
unbelievably beautiful hikes. String theorist have been coming here
every two years for quite a while. We should have some more math
workshops in Benasque!</p>
<p>I’m becoming somewhat obsessed with technology and how it’s changing
our daily life in ways we hardly have time to think about, let alone
understand. I grew up in Argentina at a time when phones were a
luxury; apartments had them or not. Here I was in Benasque sitting
under a tree facing a soccer field and some towering green mountains,
talking to my brother in Argentina on Skype through a wireless
connection to my laptop; it was right about 3pm, before the Benasque
kids came out of their siesta to play and my brother had to take his
kids to school.</p>
<p>Since writing the post on communicating mathematics today I became
more and more convinced that we, the mathematics community, are not
exploiting the available technology as much as we could.</p>
<p>Talking about this in Benasque my friend Maria mentioned Moodle a open
source management system for courses. It is now installed at UT and I
will give it a try for my graduate class this Fall. It looks really
well done, with lots of customizing possible: forums, chats, blogs,
quizzes, you name it.</p>
<p>I plan to use its “workshop” assignment module, which allows students
to grade anonymously a number of other students homework. My goal is
to give students the chance to read and assess somebody else’s
mathematics and write a report about it. It is after all what we
working mathematicians spend quite a bit of our time doing. Hopefully
the anonymous feature will also give them a flavor of the referee
system for publishing papers (without unleashing too much of the nasty
sadism that this can involve). I am all in favor of assigned work for
graduate classes in any case. To paraphrase a rock fashion designer:
“If your pants don’t hurt it ain’t rock and roll”.</p>
<p>Of course technology can be a mirage too. In a memorable story John
Tate was once asked how he dealt with papers when he was a graduate
student, an era without photocopying machines. John, without missing a
bit, answered: “We read the papers”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as Philip Candelas remarked, it is likely that at
the time one could be on top of pretty much everything being published
in a given topic.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking around for some open source software to manage
conferences, seminars, lectures, etc. Found some things but they’re
not quite it yet. Any recommendations?</p>
<p>Finally, a shameless plug. My book “Experimental Number Theory” has
finally appeared, published by Oxford University Press. It contains
many computer scripts for the wonderful Number Theory package PARI-GP
on hopefully interesting mathematics. It was a lot of fun to write and
I learned a great deal in the process. In particular, I encountered my
currently favorite elementary math problem (due to D. Knuth): A
certain baseball player has a batting average of .334. At least how
many times did he bat? (No, is not 3.)</p>
<p>The solution goes back to an algorithm of Gosper included in Hakmem,
the remarkable Hacker’s memorandum of the early 70’s.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also check my book…</p>
