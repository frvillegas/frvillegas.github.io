    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I can’t resist one last post before I go off into the webless
wilderness of the Atlantic coast. I wasn’t sure what to expect with
this blogging idea but I was more than taken aback by how fast the
blog’s existence seems to have spread. It’s exciting.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve read articles about Twyla Tharp, the american
dancer and coreographer. Somehow, I always found great affinity to her
ideas. A few months ago, in a New York Times article, she described
how she sometimes went for days without dealing with numbers (hid all
the clocks in her house, for example) to give the intuitive side of
her brain more prominence. Despite being a number theorist, I found
the thought strangely appealing rather than heretic.</p>
<p>This morning at the Harvard Coop I found she just wrote a book “The
creative habit” (published by Simon and Schuster) that I hadn’t seen
before. I just had to buy it. Here’s a representative bit:</p>
<p>“I will keep stressing the point about creativity being augmented by
routine and habit. Get used to it. In these pages a philosopical tug
of war will periodically rear its head. It is the perennial debate,
born in the Romantic era, between the beliefs that all creative acts
are born of (a) some transcendent, inexplicable Dyonisian act of
inspiration, a kiss of God on you brow that allows you to give the
world the Magic Flute, or (b) hard work.</p>
<p>If it isn’t obvious already, I come down on the side of hard
work. That’s why this book is called ‘The Creative Habit’. Creativity
is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work
habits. That’s it in a nutshell.”</p>
<p>Other ideas in the book remind me of L. Pasteur’s quote: “Chance
favors the prepared mind”. To students I have often compared doing
mathematics to fishing. You mostly sit around waiting for ideas to
bite but when a big one does you better be ready.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened. I was sitting on the lawn of Harvard
Yard reading the book when a guy comes over to ask me if he could
borrow it. He wanted to get a picture sitting on the lawn of Harvard
Yard reading a book. “Isn’t that what people do at Harvard?”, he
said. When he finished posing for the photo and was ready to leave he
asked me “And who the hell is Twyla Tharp?”</p>
