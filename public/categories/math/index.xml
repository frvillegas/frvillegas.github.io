      <description>This project got started at an fabulous workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007. In my own notes I added:&#xA;The place is truly amazing. Mountains falling over you as you walk down the street.&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms.</description>

      <description>These are notes (taken by E. Vitale) of a summer school held at the University of Bologna in the week of 22-26 May, 2023 as part of the program Quiver Representations, Quiver Varieties and Combinatorics.&#xA;This is the announcement for the course.&#xA;Counting representations of quivers over finite fields In these lectures I will present the calculation of the title in the case of the star-shaped quivers related to character varieties based on my joint work with E.</description>

      <description>In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student M. Saskia to give a mini-course at the University of Vienna. I also gave a general talk about the puzzle Blet. Later in the year I have a Basic Notions Seminar on the puzzle at ICTP.&#xA;As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the result.</description>

      <description>I gave a the kick-off Basic Notions talk at ICTP in 2014 on Impartial Games (one of the topics of the course Math, Puzzles and Computers).</description>

      <description>In the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s while monkeying around with lattice polygons, I came up with a puzzle that looked interesting. I named it Blet after my daughter Malena saying one day out of the blue: Blet, suena como un tomat. (To this day nobody can really figure out what she meant by it.)&#xA;I discussed the puzzle with my then colleagues at UT, Austin, Felipe Voloch and Lorenzo Sadun, and together worked out pretty much the whole thing and published the results.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/lecture-notes/cplx-analysis/</guid>
      <description>These are notes of a graduate course in Complex Analysis at UT Austin in 2006. Pretty standard stuff for a first course in Complex Analysis.&#xA;The history of the proof of Cauchy&amp;rsquo;s theorem has its twists and turns. I always liked Goursat&amp;rsquo;s proof that does not require continuity of first partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>K-theory and L-functions</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/lecture-notes/k-theory-l-fctns/</guid>
      <description>These are notes (taken by M. Lalín) for a course on $K$-theory and $L$-functions I gave at Harvard University in the Spring of 2002. Notes for the first few lectures were taken by S. Valverde.&#xA;The main goal of the course was to explain how to frame conceptually the numerical examples of D. Boyd relating the Mahler measure of certain two variable polynomials $A(x,y)$ and $L(E,2)$ for $E$ the elliptic curve defined by the zeros of $A$.</description>

      <description>These are notes for a course in Spanish on the Hasse-Weil zeta function given en Mérida, Venezuela in 1999.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/bernoulli/</guid>
      <description>These are notes on approaching Bernoulli polynomials as eigenvalues of certain operators acting on polynomials. It is my re-interpretation of work of E. H. Lehmer. (A new approach to Bernoulli polynomials, Amer. Math. Monthly 95(1988), 905-911.) I wrote this note at the end of my Ph.D. studies around 1989.</description>

      <title>Addition Law on Degenerate Cubics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/degenerate-cubics/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/degenerate-cubics/</guid>
      <description>These are unpublished notes in Spanish, written in 1985 when I was finishing my undergraduate degree in Buenos Aires, on defining a group law on degenerate cubics. More precisely, on cubics consisting of a smooth conic and a line. Depending on the number of intersection points of the conic and the line over the given ground field (0,1, or 2 points) you get the circle, the additive or the multiplicative group respectively.</description>
