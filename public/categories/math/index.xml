      <description>This project got started at a fabulous workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007. In my own notes I added:&#xA;The place is truly amazing. Mountains falling over you as you walk down the street.&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms.</description>

      <description>These are notes (taken by E. Vitale) of a summer school held at the University of Bologna in the week of 22-26 May, 2023 as part of the program Quiver Representations, Quiver Varieties and Combinatorics.&#xA;This is the announcement for the course.&#xA;Counting representations of quivers over finite fields In these lectures I will present the calculation of the title in the case of the star-shaped quivers related to character varieties based on my joint work with E.</description>

      <description>These are the slides of my talk at Bill Duke&amp;rsquo;s birthday conference held at ETH in Zurich. I later wrote an extended abstract of this talk. It includes a proof of the calculation of the mixed Hodge numbers of a hypergeometric motive. The original conjecture on Hodge numbers of is a paper of Corti and Golyshev. A proof was given by Fedorov.</description>

      <description>In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student Manjil P. Saikia to give a mini-course at the University of Vienna. I also gave then a general talk about the puzzle Blet. Later in the year I gave a Basic Notions Seminar on the puzzle at ICTP.&#xA;As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the result.</description>

      <description>Frequently groups of high-school students come to visit ICTP. One of their standard activities is to attend a short talk by a scientist. A number of times I gave one of these talks. In this case it was a talk for Italian students and I discussed a bit the mathematics of information transmission.</description>

      <description>I gave a the kick-off Basic Notions talk at ICTP in 2014 on Impartial Games (one of the topics of the course Math, Puzzles and Computers).&#xA;I expected students in the class to connect to puzzles and eventually to the corresponding mathematics through a chilhood experience. It is certainly what happened to me while preparing the lectures.&#xA;I have a somewhat vague but powerful memory of being introduced to the standard version of the game of Nim at an early age.</description>

      <description>In the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s while monkeying around with lattice polygons, I came up with a puzzle that looked interesting. I named it Blet after my daughter Malena saying one day out of the blue: Blet, suena como un tomat. (To this day nobody can really figure out what she meant by it.)&#xA;I discussed the puzzle with my then colleagues at UT, Austin, Felipe Voloch and Lorenzo Sadun, and together worked out pretty much the whole thing and published the results.</description>

      <description>At UT Austin there is a wonderful program of lectures for high-school students on some Saturday mornings. I gave a number of the talks there including one about lattice polygons and the number 12.</description>

      <description>These are notes of a graduate course in Complex Analysis at UT Austin in 2006. Pretty standard stuff for a first course in Complex Analysis.&#xA;The history of the proof of Cauchy&amp;rsquo;s theorem has its twists and turns. I always liked Goursat&amp;rsquo;s proof that does not require continuity of first partial derivatives.</description>

      <description>These are notes (taken by M. Lalín) for a course on $K$-theory and $L$-functions I gave at Harvard University in the Spring of 2002. Notes for the first few lectures were taken by S. Valverde.&#xA;The main goal of the course was to explain how to frame conceptually the numerical examples of D. Boyd relating the Mahler measure of certain two variable polynomials $A(x,y)$ and $L(E,2)$ for $E$ the elliptic curve defined by the zeros of $A$.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/research-talks/expl-ell-uts/</guid>
      <description>These are the slides of a talk I gave some time in 1997 on my joint work with Farshid Hajir on defining explicit elliptic units; basically trying, and to some degree succeeding, to tame the 24-th roots of unity that arise from the transformation formula of Dedekind&amp;rsquo;s eta function.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/bernoulli/</guid>
      <description>These are notes on approaching Bernoulli polynomials as eigenvalues of certain operators acting on polynomials. It is my re-interpretation of work of E. H. Lehmer. (A new approach to Bernoulli polynomials, Amer. Math. Monthly 95(1988), 905-911.) I wrote this note at the end of my Ph.D. studies around 1989.</description>

      <title>Addition Law on Degenerate Cubics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/degenerate-cubics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 1985 12:36:09 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/math/manuscripts/degenerate-cubics/</guid>
      <description>These are unpublished notes in Spanish, written in 1985 when I was finishing my undergraduate degree in Buenos Aires, on defining a group law on degenerate cubics. More precisely, on cubics consisting of a smooth conic and a line. Depending on the number of intersection points of the conic and the line over the given ground field (0,1, or 2 points) you get the circle, the additive or the multiplicative group respectively.</description>
