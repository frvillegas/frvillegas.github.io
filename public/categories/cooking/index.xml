      <description>After a fair number of iterations this is the result my cooking pasta with greens. At home we just call it Pasta Verde.&#xA;1 Start by peeling and cutting up into small cubes three medium size potatoes&#xA;2 Cut off the stems from the Swiss chard (I also added some leaves from a local variety)&#xA;3 Heat a medium size pan (7.5/10 in my induction stove) and put in the potatoes.</description>

      <description>Many years ago after an invited seminar talk at ISTA in Vienna we went with my host Tamas Hausel and some of his group for dinner to a Croatian restaurant.

I found out later (while on vacation in Lussinpicolo) that it is actually a standard traditional dish in Croacia known as blitva (which simply means chard).</description>
