      <description>Iperborea is an italian publishing house founded by Emilia Lodigiani in 1987 which aims to bring to Italian readers the literature of northern Europe. Their books have a distinctive format and texture of their covers making them instantly recognizable while browsing in a bookstore. Not all of their titles are easy to find in English in Italy so they are a good way for me to connect to Scandinavian culture while also practicing my Italian.</description>

      <description>This project got started at a fabulous workshop held in Benasque, Spain (in the mountains, a few hours drive from Barcelona) in 2009. I wrote this post in my blog after returning from another workshop there on p-adic analysis in 2007. In my own notes I added:&#xA;The place is truly amazing. Mountains falling over you as you walk down the street.&#xA;The plan of the 2009 workshop was to explore ways to compute exotic L-functions, not arising from elliptic curves or usual modular forms.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of my Ph.D. years at The Ohio State University together with a bunch of graduate students we thought of publishing our own magazine. We struggled to come up with a good name for it so after a lot of back and forth we settled on &amp;ldquo;The Empy Set&amp;rdquo;. The OSU graduate advisor found this too nihilistic and wanted us to pick a different name. We nevertheless wrote what inevitably ended up being the only issue of &amp;ldquo;The Empty Set&amp;rdquo; and circulated it among the department.</description>

      <description>I listened to a fascinating podcast in the &amp;ldquo;Past, Present, Future&amp;rdquo; series by David Runciman on the 1726 satire &amp;ldquo;Gulliver&amp;rsquo;s Travels&amp;rdquo; by Jonathan Swift. Runciman gives an excellent summary of the various journeys that Gulliver undertakes in this book; journeys to far away lands were he encounters fantastic creatures and their world: tiny people, giants, talking horses, and the like.&#xA;In one of these journeys Gulliver finds academics stubbornly determined to strip language of all ambiguity.</description>

      <description>I love this picture.&#xA;Early in the morning in the Barrio Gotico of Barcelona. As I walked by I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help hearing part of the conversation. The young woman seemed to be asking in good but accented Spanish where she could find a particular kind of cheese. I imagine she thought the old ladies were locals that would know.&#xA;View this post on Instagram </description>

      <description>Let’s talk figs.&#xA;There was a fig tree near the main house “Villa Isaura” in Carlos Paz, Cordoba where I spent many a holiday as a kid. I remember breaking off leaves to see and feel the white sticky substance that came out. It was a somewhat mysterious and out of the way tree, with strange gnarly branches and big dark green leaves, a huge contrast to the tall, straight and ubiquitous eucalyptus trees that lined up so many sidewalks of my Buenos Aires childhood.</description>

      <description>One of the odd perks of getting old is that one can look back to the distant past and wonder with cold detachment just who the hell we were.&#xA;As a kid I was obsessed with cryptography and secret messages. I even halfheartedly tried to create a language that only my friends and I would understand. I wanted to build a robot. I also wanted to live in a desert island and made endless plans in my head on how I would run my life on it.</description>

      <description>In 2018 I was invited by my former ICTP Diploma student Manjil P. Saikia to give a mini-course at the University of Vienna. I also gave a general talk about the puzzle Blet. Later in the year I have a Basic Notions Seminar on the puzzle at ICTP.&#xA;As an experiment I got the transcript of the talk from youtube and then ran it through ChatGPT. After some light editing here is the result.</description>

      <description>Frequently groups of high-school students come to visit ICTP. One of their standard activities is to attend a short talk by a scientist. A number of times I gave one of these talks. In this case it was a talk for Italian students and I discussed a bit the mathematics of information transmission.</description>

      <description>Like a teenager keeping a journal I note in shame that my last post here is from 2012. Since then I have moved to Trieste, Italy, taking a job at the ICTP: Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics.&#xA;Horculas en el migo. And so it is.&#xA;Looking back, it is clear that growing up in Buenos Aires shaped my view of the world, what to expect from the day to day of life.</description>

      <description>I gave a the kick-off Basic Notions talk at ICTP in 2014 on Impartial Games (one of the topics of the course Math, Puzzles and Computers).&#xA;I expected students in the class to connect to puzzles and eventually to the corresponding mathematics through a chilhood experience. It is certainly what happened to me while preparing the lectures.&#xA;I have a somewhat vague but powerful memory of being introduced to the standard version of the game of Nim at an early age.</description>

      <description>I am not sure if it is an Austin phenomenon or not but I have had a few interesting taxi rides back and forth to the airport over the years.&#xA;I’ll leave aside the late night taxi ride where the driver, a young woman, told a few off-color jokes (“you are not a prude man, are you?”); including one that I am pretty sure was popular when I was in primary school.</description>

      <description>I’ve lived in the US now for over 22 years. I have encountered two dollar bills exactly three times (I kept them all). The first time was around Harvard Square as change in a store. It was so strange.&#xA;I’ve seen a few dollar coins too. Usually all of them at once unfortunately. At least 15 years ago, if you bought a NJ transit train ticket in a machine at the station and paid with a 20 dollar bill the change came clanking down in a stream of dollar coins.</description>

      <description>While I wait for my brain strings to settle after a long summer shuttling about I make a quick core dump before it’s all gone.&#xA;I spent two weeks in Benasque, Spain for the workshop P-adic analysis, Periods and Physics . We ended up being a very small group of participants, unfortunate in a way but the result was a very charming workshop. And what a place! Benasque is in a valley in the Spanish Pyrenees not far from the border with France, a small mountain town where you walk everywhere, surrounded by amazing mountains full of unbelievably beautiful hikes.</description>

      <description>I can’t resist one last post before I go off into the webless wilderness of the Atlantic coast. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this blogging idea but I was more than taken aback by how fast the blog’s existence seems to have spread. It’s exciting.&#xA;Over the years I’ve read articles about Twyla Tharp, the american dancer and coreographer. Somehow, I always found great affinity to her ideas. A few months ago, in a New York Times article, she described how she sometimes went for days without dealing with numbers (hid all the clocks in her house, for example) to give the intuitive side of her brain more prominence.</description>

      <description>In the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s while monkeying around with lattice polygons, I came up with a puzzle that looked interesting. I named it Blet after my daughter Malena saying one day out of the blue: Blet, suena como un tomat. (To this day nobody can really figure out what she meant by it.)&#xA;I discussed the puzzle with my then colleagues at UT, Austin, Felipe Voloch and Lorenzo Sadun, and together worked out pretty much the whole thing and published the results.</description>

      <description>These are notes of a graduate course in Complex Analysis at UT Austin in 2006. Pretty standard stuff for a first course in Complex Analysis.&#xA;The history of the proof of Cauchy&amp;rsquo;s theorem has its twists and turns. I always liked Goursat&amp;rsquo;s proof that does not require continuity of first partial derivatives.</description>

      <description>These are notes (taken by M. Lalín) for a course on $K$-theory and $L$-functions I gave at Harvard University in the Spring of 2002. Notes for the first few lectures were taken by S. Valverde.&#xA;The main goal of the course was to explain how to frame conceptually the numerical examples of D. Boyd relating the Mahler measure of certain two variable polynomials $A(x,y)$ and $L(E,2)$ for $E$ the elliptic curve defined by the zeros of $A$.</description>

      <description>These are notes on approaching Bernoulli polynomials as eigenvalues of certain operators acting on polynomials. It is my re-interpretation of work of E. H. Lehmer. (A new approach to Bernoulli polynomials, Amer. Math. Monthly 95(1988), 905-911.) I wrote this note at the end of my Ph.D. studies around 1989.</description>

      <description>These are unpublished notes in Spanish, written in 1985 when I was finishing my undergraduate degree in Buenos Aires, on defining a group law on degenerate cubics. More precisely, on cubics consisting of a smooth conic and a line. Depending on the number of intersection points of the conic and the line over the given ground field (0,1, or 2 points) you get the circle, the additive or the multiplicative group respectively.</description>
